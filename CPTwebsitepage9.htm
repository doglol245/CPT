<P ALIGN="CENTER"> My reflection for my seventh artifact: </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"> The reason why I like the faith walk so much is because I was able to bond with my classmates a lot and I got to walk around the school to enjoy the fresh air. I feel that as a class we needed this assignment to help us take our mind off things and clear our head. It was a great walk. I was able to take a lot of pictures of interesting statues and photos around the school. </P>
