<P ALIGN="CENTER"> My reflection for my first artifact: </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"> The reason why I like the Wix website is because it was my first time making a web site and I had a lot of fun making something I have never done before. I had a fun time trying different styles for my website and contrasting different colors together. I like this and I feel like I gained a lot from making this website and I feel that I would do this again in the future. </P>
