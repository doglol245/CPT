<P ALIGN="CENTER"> My reflection for my second artifact: </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"> The reason why I liked the facetime project  the most was because I got to  work with people i never worked with before. I also want to learn why facetime was important to schooling. This was one of my first group projects and I had a great time. There was a lot of communication with the group and the slides were organized to perfection. That's why I like this project so much. </P>
