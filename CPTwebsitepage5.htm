<P ALIGN="CENTER"> My reflection for my first artifact: </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"> The reason why I liked the HTML website is because I feel like I gained more knowledge about the web. I feel as if I expanded my technical abilities when working on this project. At times it was very rough doing this but I was able to learn from my mistakes and continue on from them. The biggest reason why I like this project is because I like to reflect on what I did back in the year and I feel like in this project I did that. </P>
