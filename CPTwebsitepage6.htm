<P ALIGN="CENTER"> My reflection for my fourth artifact: </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"> The reason why I liked the graph project is because, when doing this project I got to learn more about different graphs and how they work. I got to learn many functions of why a graph is important in business. I also expanded my abilities on spreadsheets and what each formula meant. It gave me a better understanding of what to do. </P>
