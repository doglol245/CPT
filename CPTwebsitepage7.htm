<P ALIGN="CENTER"> My reflection for my fifth artifact: </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"> The reason why I like spreadsheet work is because I got to work with money. I really enjoy working with money. I like to calculate the difference in money and love to work with math. There are a lot of math problems that have to do with math and that is what I love. I like to challenge myself with math and that's what this assignment did. </P>
