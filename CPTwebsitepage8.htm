<P ALIGN="CENTER"> My reflection for my sixth artifact: </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"> The reason why I like the party assignment so much is because I feel that I had a lot of fun making it.it was also the first group project so i got to work with others for the first time. I gained a lot of knowledge from it. For example, I was  able to learn how to write a letter to other people. Which is a life skill I can carry on for the rest of my life. </P>
